# Survivorship and Mortality Rates

Suppose that of a cohort of 150 mice in a mouse colony
born in February, 125 are still at the end of March and 
115 are still alive at the end of April.

## What is the survivorship up to the start of April?

(Round to the nearest hundredth.)


## What is the mortality rate during the month of March?

(Round to the nearest hundredth.)


## If the survivorship during May is 0.5, how many mice will there be at the end of May?

(Round to the nearest whole number.)
